            <p>Deep within UCLA Special Collections lies a program from the 19th Annual Academy Awards, universally known as “The Oscars”. Within its pages, the program contains the names of the Academy’s officers and Board of Governors, the master of ceremonies, celebrity presenters, and award nominees. Comedian and actor Jack Benny was the emcee of the 19th Awards ceremony, which took place on March 13, 1947. Benny was accompanied by celebrity presenters such as Ronald Reagan, Shirley Temple, and Frank Sinatra.</p>
            <p>The film industry’s most anticipated event of the year is a tradition that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has been upholding since 1929.  The Academy itself originated a few years prior, in 1927.  The idea for the Academy stemmed from the collaboration of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s Louis B. Mayer, actor Conrad Nagel, director Fred Niblo, and producer Fred Beetson.  These men intended to create an official organization that would benefit the entire film industry.  On January 11, 1927, thirty-six people met at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles to listen to the proposal for the founding of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Attendees supported the proposal, thus accelerating the process to create the Academy.  By March, a board of officers was elected and Douglas Fairbanks was named the first president of the Academy. A few months later, the state of California granted the Academy a charter as a non-profit organization and the Academy gained 230 more members. Five branches of the Academy were established: producers, directors, actors, writers, and technicians.</p>
            <p>Two years after it was established, the Academy decided to hold an event that would recognize excellence within the film industry. The first Academy Awards ceremony took place in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel’s banquet room on May 16, 1929.  270 people attended and paid five dollars each for tickets which, with inflation, translates to approximately $68 today. Unlike today’s proceedings, the winners of the first Academy awards were announced prior to the ceremony. The following year, the winners were kept secret until the ceremony; however, the Academy provided a list of winners to newspapers so that they could publish the list of winners at 11 p.m. on the night of the ceremony.  This became a tradition every year until 1940, when the Los Angeles Times published the names of the winners in its evening edition, prior to the ceremony.  This leak prompted the Academy to implement the sealed-envelope system in 1941, which is still in place today.</p>
            <p>In 1942 (the 16th ceremony), because of increased audience, the event was held in a theater for the first time.  Three years later, the 19th Awards ceremony was subsequently held in the Shrine Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles on Thursday, March 13, 1947.  For the first time in the history of the Academy Awards, the general public was invited to buy tickets.  Also for the first time, foreign films were more prominent than ever.</p>
            <p>The American movie The Best Years of Our Lives dominated the awards ceremony, winning Best Motion Picture (Samuel Goldwyn for RKO Radio Pictures), Best Adapted Screenplay (Robert E. Sherwood), Best Musical Score of a dramatic or comedy picture (Hugo Friedhofer), Best Film Editing (Daniel Mandell), Best Directing (William Wyler), Best Actor (Fredric March), and Best Supporting Actor (Harold Russell).  Harold Russell’s story alone is something to marvel at because, unlike the other actors competing in his category, Russell was an amateur.  He was an ex-serviceman whose hands had been blown off by TNT; therefore, William Wyler cast him as the character Homer because both men had hooks instead of hands.  The movie itself reflected the post-war era of the late 1940s, as it explored how three veterans adjusted as they returned home from World War II.  The theme of soldiers’ homecoming and re-acclimatization into society is a universal theme that is still relevant today.</p>
