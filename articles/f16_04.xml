            <p>This image, Smog Man, shows the powerful effects of air pollution on city residents. The man in the foreground is wearing a large mask covering his entire face, in hopes of filtering the air that he is breathing. Two women slightly behind him are wiping their eyes with handkerchiefs, presumably because the dirty air is creating irritation. The building in the far left is barely visible because of contaminated air, making it seem as if there is a curtain of smoke covering it. In the late sixties, Smog Man and other eye-opening pictures began to catch the attention of many.</p>
            <p>Smog formation occurs when automobiles and factories release pollutants such as hydrocarbons, water vapor, carbon monoxide, and heavy metals into the atmosphere. These chemicals react when exposed to sunshine and produce secondary pollutants, including ozone and nitrogen dioxide. Los Angeles is prone to an inversion layer, where a cool air mass from the Pacific Ocean slips underneath a warm layer, and is blown inland. The warm layer prohibits the smog from moving upward and escaping, and the San Gabriel mountains prevent the smog from traveling inland. The consequence is trapped polluted air in the Los Angeles area.</p>
			<p>The 1960s and 1970s were a turbulent time for Los Angeles as smog plagued the city. LA’s abundant cars made for excessive smog. In addition, factories and industry significantly contributed to bad air.  As a result, the city enforced standards on industry “by limiting the sulfur content of fuels, and by specifying the kinds of equipment that must be used in various industrial and agricultural operations,” indicating the city’s efforts to reduce industrial air pollution (Boffey, 991). Moreover, Los Angeles banned the use of coal in 1968 because the combustion of coal yields nitrogen dioxide, a component of smog, which is usually released into the atmosphere (Boffey, 991). Other district actions included the closing of “57 open burning dumps, about a dozen large municipal incinerators, most commercial building incinerators, and about 1 ½ million domestic incinerators” (Boffey, 991).</p>
			<p>Air pollution was a problem in downtown Los Angeles long before this photo was taken. Dating back to a July morning in 1940, with no prior knowledge of smog, citizens started to complain about eye and throat irritations (Brienes, 515). The situation increasingly worsened, and theories about gas attacks abounded. Occasionally, smog would gather heavily during the day, and after a few hours, the sky would clear up. The city’s newspaper finally came up with the headline “Smog ha[s] come to stay,” after the dense haze visited Los Angeles on and off for weeks (Brienes, 516). Consequently, the California Weather Bureau and other health authorities analyzed the composition of air from previous years, identified the sources of pollutants, and put forward a series of regulations (Brienes, 516). For decades, citizens made many efforts to fight off smog with little success.</p>
			<p>As initial solutions to smog did not work, Angelenos came up with more proposals to regulate the air as well as protect their own health. The solutions can be classified into three categories. First, researchers encouraged citizens to increase the use of ventilation machines to purify the air. Secondly, authorities required companies to collect their waste and enclose their combustion byproducts. Finally, the government provided gas masks for citizens and recommended wearing them in all living spaces (Marvin, 340). Because Los Angeles was one of the earliest cities to be engulfed in smog, very few ideas to target air pollution were in place. Some of the proposals were very rational and ultimately made into laws. One of the most significant laws was Rule 66, which mainly limited the emission of organic solvent from stationary sources. The law began with the observation of large amounts of organic pollutants discharged by non-vehicular sources, such as industrial, commercial, and residential paint (Marvin, 342). Collaborating with industries, the Air Pollution Control District of Los Angeles established regulations against certain organic solvent-containing products. Authorities restricted the use of chemicals such as toluene and carbon atoms in production, limiting the contaminants emitted from daily trash. The percentage of these chemicals in the atmosphere decreased greatly after several years (Marvin, 342).</p>
			<p>Eventually, environmental advocacy became a subject of discourse across the nation, leading to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. The EPA opened a case study regarding the smog levels in Los Angeles and was tasked with finding a viable solution to reduce the overall toxins found in the air. After much trial and error, the creation of the catalytic converter took place. This device drastically reduced the amount of smog emitted from a car’s tailpipe, resulting in an overall decrease of pollutants in the air. After the implementation of the catalytic converter, the peak ozone levels in Los Angeles dropped from 0.61ppm (parts per million) in 1958 to 0.39ppm in 1976. Since then, Angelenos have been able to breathe cleaner air.</p>
