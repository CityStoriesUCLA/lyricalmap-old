            <p>Los Angeles skating culture in the 1970s left an indelible mark on the sport and on its cultural identity through the emergence of skateboarding legends and empty pools. It was the time where boundaries, limits, and perceptions around skateboarding were broken. Because of the advancements in skating, many influential photographers flooded Los Angeles at a chance to capture the spirit and essence of skateboarders’ monumental discoveries. The home of many of these discoveries was the Dog Bowl.</p>
            <p>Because of mid-to-late nineteen-seventies oil rationing and water drought in Southern California, many people emptied and abandoned their swimming pools since the cost of repairs and maintenance was so high. Skateboarders used these emptied pools to evolve their skills. It was these empty pools that gave the structure of the Dog Bowl which gave home to Dogtown’s finest, Z-boys which included Tony Alva, Jay Adams, and Stacy Peralta. The Bowl was created through a teenager with terminal cancer who asked his parents to let the Z-boys drain their family pool on their huge estate which overlooked The Brentwood Country Club Golf Course. The parents agreed to this offer, giving a place for the Z-boys to train peacefully. Since most pools were off-limit or illegal, The Dog Bowl, a “permission pool”(Bowman), was exclusively used by the Z-boys except for a few invited guests such as the Val Surf Team who was on par with the Z-boys’ abilities. Some of the most intense skateboarding sessions occurred in this pool. With the steep incline of the pool and the rebellious nature of these skateboarders, they created a new form of skateboarding called vertical skating. This form of skating were despised by many street-skaters as it added an element of danger. Limits were broken, new boundaries were formed, and new skills were made. Because of the advancement of skateboarding, these high-level sessions garnered the attention of many prolific photographers. William and Stanley Sharp photographed many of the sessions for the Skateboard World Magazine, while Ray Flores and Ray Allen filmed shots of the sessions which were featured on the DVD, Dogtown and Z-Boys. Of the photographers, Glen E. Friedman took some of the most inspirational and historical photos.</p>
			<p>Born in North Carolina, Glen E. Friedman grew up in the city of Los Angeles. He spent a lot of his time skateboarding but also was an experienced photographer for Z-Boys. SkateBoarder Magazine employed Friedman in 1976 as the youngest member of their staff. Friedman had always owned a professional 35mm camera, but when he was first starting off he would use his less sophisticated “pocket instamatic” camera. It was with this cheap camera that he photographed his friends such as Tony Alva at The Dog Bowl.</p>
			<p>Known for his powerful images of defiant artists, Friedman became one of the most influential photographers of his generation. His works range from skateboarding, hip-hop and punk. Some of his famous clients include artists like Black Flag, Fugazi, Beastie Boys, and Ice- T. Many of Friedman’s photographs have been displayed in museums and art galleries all around the world. Original copies of his work can be found in the photography collections of the Berkeley Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, Pacific Film Archive, and many more. Aside from all his work with skating, punk and hip-hop photography, Friedman is currently a political activist leaning towards the liberal side, and follows a strict vegan diet as well.</p>
			<p>The picture is of skateboarder Tony Alva riding the Dog Bowl. Here, Tony performs a trick to be captured on video. Fortunately, Friedman was at the right spot at the right time, ready to shoot Tony in midair.  Notable is the Dog Bowl’s location in an affluent neighborhood.  With the trees glistening off the strong sunlight and bright blue skies, the picture was most likely taken in the spring or summer. Most of the spectators are wearing clothes that suit a typical hot sunny Southern California day. Taking a break from the heat, all of the people except one are sitting down enjoying the view of Alva shredding the waterless pool. Friedman uses advancements in camera technology, for example, their fish eye lens of the current photo.</p>
			<p>The Dogbowl and this specific picture represented the progress of skateboard culture in Los Angeles, with the emergence of surfers performing dangerous tricks on the curved walls of empty swimming pools. As a result, a whole new era of brands, magazines and companies were created which nurtured this new subculture in teenagers. Skaters with outstanding skills were sponsored by brands like Vans and vertical skating brought a whole new image to skateboarding. No longer was skating limited to streets, ramps and stairs. Now, skating contained a new element of excitement and danger with the introduction of large half ramps, curved wooden walls and empty pools.</p>
