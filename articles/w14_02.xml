            <p>The document, “Preventive Social Casework: Finding Skid Row-like People,” includes different programs to improve the overall condition in Los Angeles Skid Row for the successful proceeding of the Central City Development plan. According to the document, unless the potential investors of Central City were guaranteed that Skid Row’s poverty would not contaminate the redeveloped Central City area, the redevolopment plan could hardly proceed. The item presented not a detailed plan but several suggestions to improve service, detox, and housing and health aspects of Skid Row. The goal of these suggestions, according to the article, is to “ reduce, contain and eventually eliminate Skid Row”.</p>
            <p>Los Angeles Skid Row covers fifty square blocks in the downtown area, which has traditionally served as a point of congregation for the homeless. The density, visibility, and the demographics of the population are unique and significant. According to a 2007 count by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, “Skid Row’s 0.18% of Los Angeles’ area contains 12.8% of the city’s homeless population” (Salim 9). The great concentration of resources in Skid Row also contributes to its vital importance. “While Skid Row represents 0.18% of the city’s area, it has 33% of the shelter beds available citywide and just under 20% of the beds available countywide” (Salim 9). These factors make Skid Row a focal point of homelessness in Los Angeles.</p>
            <p>The document says that these social programs were proposed to prevent the contamination of Skid Row’s poverty onto the nearby and redeveloped Central City area; however, the revitalization of downtown Los Angeles has worsened the condition of Skid Row, “Thousands of new construction and adaptive reuse units have been added to the Core, new residents are becoming part of the scene, and a certain buzz is in the air” (Salim, 2). Due to the proximity of Skid Row to the Historic Core, great effects have been brought to Skid Row during the redevelopment process of Central City. One of the most important effects was that the revitalization limited the availability of properties for use by service providers in Skid Row, especially the buildings. Adaptive reuse of underutilized buildings in Central City has generated demand for a variety of buildings, reducing the buildings available for service providers. Also, the prices of properties have been affected. When new residents came, demand for properties increased, which increased the prices of these properties. As a result, many non-profit organizations could no longer afford the properties (Salim 13). Thus, the conditions in Skid Row have gotten worse because of the forces of downtown change and urban renewal.</p>
            <p>First person accounts of Skid Row must be read in order to understand its psychological state. The newspaper article, “A Corner in Which LA Hits Rock Bottom” by Steve Lopez reveals the current appalling state of Skid Row and its people. The area is filled with Porta- Potties, defecation, rats, and prostitution (Lopez, Los Angeles Times, 2005). These Porta-Potties, although disgusting, became home for many of the inhabitants of Skid Row. The article uses actual names and real-life situations in order to express the deteriorating morale behind Skid Row; this allows the depictions and historical descriptions of Skid Row to come to life and impact the reader emotionally.</p>
            <p>A contemporary newspaper article allows for the comparison Skid Row to its past status. Steve Lopez captures the atmosphere of Skid Row through observational accounts and the story of two women named T.J and T.T, which stand for Thick and Juicy, and Tall and Tiny. Lopez captures a significant moment in which the neglect and carelessness of the Skid Row people was apparent, just as the Special Collection item had explained roughly thirty years ago. During what appears to have been a drug overdose by T.T, both Lopez and T.J contact paramedics in a panic; however, although in dire need of help, T.T waves the paramadics goodbye and they leave as if nothing had happened. T.T and T.J explain why and how they relocated to Skid Row and how insignificant they feel in comparison to the world (Lopez, Los Angeles Times, 2005). Both characters explain that they both have a place of residence, in another city but something draws them to the Porta-Potties of Skid Row which they explain gives them all they need (Lopez). This shows the psychological state of the inhabitants of Skid Row; they feel as though they themselves cannot escape its grasp; they’ve defined new standards of living, a lower standard of living. The environment of Skid Row has affected their psychological state of mind. This article reveals an insight into the minds of the people of Skid Row. By understanding the people of Skid Row, it is possible to understand why Skid Row still exists, even after it was established as a problem about thirty years ago.</p>
            <p>The article "Blues Geographies and the Security Turn: Interpreting the Housing Crisis in Los Angeles" reveals the attitudes towards Skid Row following the Housing Crisis of the 1980s and the genuine disregard for this. The city and its government sees Skid Row as a way to contain disposable peoples; it is an “open-air prison” (Camp). Skid Row contains “the highest concentration of homeless people in the city and the most concentrated poverty in the United States” (Camp).  By the 1990s, Skid Row experienced gentrification with the help of police control and order. This was an attempt by the city to reclaim its land. Gentrification allowed for the criminalization of homelessness and the persistent incarceration of Skid Row inhabitants. The Special Collections item attributed one of the problems of Skid Row to be the abusing policing and incarceration, yet, twenty years later during the 1990s the problem persisted with a renewed intensity. The policing problem only worsened as the years progressed. In 2006, the city launched what they referred to as the “Safe Cities Initiative” which was “an unprecedented employment of police power” within Skid Row. As the years go on, Skid Row remains, with no end in sight.</p>
