            <p>Chip Jacobs and William Kelly’s Smogtown describes many aspects of the history of pollution in Los Angeles, including the discovery of its scientific makeup, effects on the city and influence on public policy.What makes this copy unique is the inscription on the front cover by one of the authors, Chip Jacobs, thanking UCLA for supplying sources used to create the essence of the book. Many of the photos and information were found at the Department of Special Collections at Charles E. Young Research Library at the University of California Los Angeles. While Smogtown was published in 2008, it makes many historical references to UCLA, which had an impact in the unfolding of smog.</p>  
            <p>The composition of smog was discovered as a result of political strife. Louis C. McCabe was tasked with discovering the origins of smog, in order to save his position as the director of L.A. County Air Pollution. He hired Arie Haagen-Smit, who trapped “30,000 cubic feet of Pasadena air” in his laboratory and exposed the origin of smog. When he extracted “a few drops of chocolate-colored, rancid-smelling liquid” (Jacob and Kelly 85) from the air Haagen-Smit identified nitrogen gases and volatile organic compounds, both major components of emissions from cars and oil industries. His findings caused great political controversy because oil and automobiles were massive parts of the economy. Once Haagen-Smit’s research became public, a UCLA physiologist told a reporter that no one attempted to solve the smog issue because of the subsequent economic and political problems that would arise (Jacobs and Kelly 104), thus leaving McCabe out of a job. In 1954, in order to combat the political controversy and the smog issue, the Chancellor of UCLA was named chairman of  Southern California Air Pollution Foundation to give it a more “prestigious sheen” (Jacobs and Kelly 123) and political power. Because of Arie Haagen-Smit and the University of California Los Angeles, the smog issue was busted wide open.</p>
            <p>Smog is not simply a matter that is displeasing to the eye; there are more serious effects that arise from air pollution. Sulfur burning refineries greatly contributed to the problem. Kelly and Jacobs further this point by mentioning George L. Schuler, an ex-Pasadena city councilman and mechanical engineer, and his two-year study of smog, after which he asserted, “sulfur poisoning… had easily doubled fatal heart attacks in Pasadena from 1938 to 1948 as part of the 10,000 people he purported area smog had killed” (Jacobs and Kelly 45). But, not all effects were as noticeable to the eye. There also seemed to be psychological consequences from exposure to such strong gases. “California’s mental health director speculated that that auto fumes swirling inside the unhealthy air were so poisonous neurologically that it actually shook some individuals’ sanity” (Jacobs and Kelly 103).</p>
            <p>City borders could not restrict smog; farmers in the mid-1940s noticed that their crops were perishing from the toxic gas. As a result, many farmers lost money because of the destroyed crops. Some farmers stopped harvesting altogether. In one account, a “grower suffered $30,000 in dead crops within twelve hours of the vapors’ arrival” (Jacobs and Kelly 50). More reports like this became very common and “by 1954, experts estimated the loss to Southland crops at $3 million” (Jacobs and Kelly 52). Oil companies also caused pollution, which would prove to be an especially difficult situation to manage; with a “region whose population nearly doubles in ten years”, Los Angeles needed to produce more oil. But, more oil would mean more emissions. Air pollution was clearly jeopardizing the future of Southern California.</p>
            <p>Ronald Reagan governed the state of California in the 1970s with relaxed policies on regulating pollution control. His pro-business strategy was widely popular, and was part of a general political trend throughout the state that favored the unrestricted free market as opposed to governing bodies. Jacobs and Kelly describe Reagan as being inattentive when dealing with environmental agency authorities, often changing the subject when environmental protection authorities tried to address the growing pollution crisis. Following Reagan’s term as governor, there was a shift in political authority. Governor Jerry Brown prioritized pollution control to make good on his campaign promise to “restore blue skies over California”. This dynamic political shift over the period of these two administrations caused tension within the state government. The auto industry corporations, which were unrestricted under Reagan, were now forced to include basic pollution control devices in all newly manufactured vehicles. Retrofit pollution devices and catalytic converters were new requirements for all cars manufactured and sold. As a result, Los Angeles was able to mitigate the smog problem without greatly compromising the profitability of the automobile and oil industries (Jacobs and Kelley 75-77).</p>

            <p>This special collections text was put together by many contributers, many of whom researched at UCLA. The book discusses the long history of growing air pollution in the City of Los Angeles, and examines the environmental, political and health implications of the issue.</p>
