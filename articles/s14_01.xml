            <p>The Los Angeles Aqueduct Digital Platform (LAADP) contextualizes the history of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, revealing the various social, political, and environmental impacts it has made on the community and the nation. Through the compilation of various text and media samples such as photographs, maps, newspapers clippings, and pamphlets, the public is able to look at past archives to discover the historical significance behind the Los Angeles Aqueduct. This platform enables scholars and students alike to assess how the community has managed water over the past century, and provides ideas on how to continue maintaining it throughout the next century and beyond. The nature of databases proves to be unbiased because they draw from so many different sources, libraries, and other research institutions. The LAADP is fashioned in the same way, putting heavy emphasis on the diverse list of resources it pulls from. It provides permanent samples from over a century’s worth of historical events, cultivating dynamic conversations over the innovative perspectives it reveals. The LAADP encourages users to search the database for entries to assist in research projects, as well as discover objective historical documents that are collectively reliable.</p>
            <p>Within the database itself, users have three initial options: search the ‘Archive’ section for a specific article, use ‘Resources’ to find the sources for various material on the aqueduct, as well as take a look at its cartography, or explore various new topics regarding the aqueduct under the ‘Scholarship’ option. Within the third option, users can peruse an assortment of different annotations provided, varying from the aqueduct’s construction, to literature specifically on its history, to a mise-en-discourse on the 1974 film Chinatown. These sources can be used today to look back on how environmental laws have since changed and perhaps reflect on what can be improved on this aqueduct and ones to come.</p>
            <p>The LAADP is extremely useful in providing accurate historical information, as well as a deeper level of understanding about the origins of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. The information researched on the topic of the Owens River Valley provided original newspaper articles and other first-person documents that revealed the truths behind the aqueduct project. Within these articles, it was discovered that the designers of the aqueduct, Fred Eaton and William Mulholland, performed a variety of deceitful acts in order to officialize the ownership of the Owens River Valley for Los Angeles. They secured the rights to the River Valley by tricking nearby residents into believing they had intentions to create a public irrigation system that would benefit the community. The articles continue on to explain the amount of pressure the officials of Los Angeles felt during the large increase in population density, ultimately resulting in drought and other environmental consequences; however, the physical process of building the aqueduct yielded benefits such as more high-paying jobs for the community. This boosted the Los Angeles economy and initiated a few decades of prosperity for the city.  Actual blueprints of the aqueduct help to depict the logistics of the project with stunning details ranging from cost breakdowns to timelines. They also provide insight on how architects and engineers envisioned how a proper aqueduct should be built, giving their modern counterparts a reference of innovation’s past and its do’s and don’ts. Black and white photos provide unparalleled visuals of what the area actually looked like at the time of the scandal. Ultimately, the LAADP shares all the aspects of the extraordinary history of the Aqueduct with the Los Angeles community and beyond.</p>
            <p>In the modern age, where technology and digital resources have overtaken books and papers as the dominant sources of learning, the LAADP acts as a bridge between informational resources of the past and the present and greatly simplifies the modern research process. Traditionally, the general public has had restricted access to rare primary sources since the artifacts are irreproducible. Having the LAADP online prevents the need for special permission, which usually requires a lengthy process, and visits to library special collections and museums scattered across the globe by eradicating the fear of losing or damaging the precious resources. Information is preserved immortally on the Internet where it may be accessed indefinitely without unintentional alteration. The Los Angeles Aqueduct database establishes a link to other modern informational networks on the web that may contain other unique artifacts that the database may not directly have. Consequently, platform users are empowered with seemingly limitless access to information at their fingertips. Overall, the Los Angeles Aqueduct database is an important resource in today’s world that centralizes rare artifacts and information from all around the world into one place. Using the power of digitalization and the Internet, the database provides the capability to not only protect irreplaceable artifacts but provide safe public access to them.</p>
