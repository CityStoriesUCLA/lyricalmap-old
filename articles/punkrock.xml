            <p>For a single beat, there falls a silence as quiet as death. The oppressive heat of the club  is stifling as the walls themselves seem to hold their breath in anticipation. A moment later and the quiet is splintered by an eruption of noise: the sharp snap of the snare drum, the throaty reverberation of the bass tangling with the whine of a worn-down Ibanez guitar. In the middle of it all, fighting against the currents of sound, is photographer Glen E. Friedman. Cradling his battered Pentax k1000 camera in both hands, he stands, unyielding, amidst the heavy waves of punk rock fans. Pressing impossibly closer, Friedman matches the band in both intensity and urgency with each click of his flash. Friedman’s photographs of the Bad Brains and Minor Threat captured the essence of the American punk movement by documenting its concerts and prominent venues.</p>
            <p>Friedman’s photographs display the beginning of the hardcore punk movement that emerged in the East Coast of the United States. During the late 70s, punk music started to become famous all over the world and was categorized by  three major movements. Punk rock started in London and then moved across the Atlantic to the United States where the New York/Washington D.C and Los Angeles scenes arose. The first East Coast musicians became known for their hardcore punk style that was faster in tempo and more musically disorganized.</p>
            <p>Though Friedman’s photographs are documentary in style, he insists that he is a fine art photographer. The images carry a gritty, devil-may-care quality; a recklessness that stands in harsh contrast to the carefully composed impartiality of documentary photography. As the music pulses and the drummer thrashes with fervor, Friedman allows himself to be buffeted by the sway of the mob. He steals a quick, flashing frame of movement that seems to contain something electric: a fragment of fiery energy from the performance. The lighting is jarring, and it glares against the muted darkness that surrounds the stage, but Friedman manages to command the unnatural beams of light and the panting, sweaty scowls of the vocalist and the writhing, surging limbs of the crowd.</p>
            <p>The Bad Brains photograph depicts Dr. Know and H.R (guitarist and singer respectively) performing at the CBGB in New York City. The Bad Brains’ unique sound, which blends elements of metal, funk, hip-hop, and soul, made them the pioneers of hardcore punk in Washington D.C during the late 1970s. They went on to perform and spread the punk culture all over the world through the 80s and are one of the few original punk bands that continue to perform today. The other photograph shows Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat performing at the 9:30 club in Washington D.C. The band is considered to be a founder of hardcore punk, and set the standard for many emerging punk bands in the 80s. Minor Threat is commonly associated with the “Straight Edge Movement,” which originated from their hit song “Straight Edge.” The Straight Edge movement was a hardcore punk subculture that was against substance abuse, including alcohol and drugs; it even promoted abstinence and vegetarian diets which was an anomaly within punk culture. Both the CBGB and the 9:30 Club went on to become central locations for punk concerts and greatly influenced the hardcore movement.</p>
            <p>The 9:30 Club is one of the most well known live-music clubs in the United States and a primary venue for punk rock. This all-ages club is currently located in the north-western part of Washington D.C, and was named after its original location on 930 St in downtown Washington. Many famous performers have taken the stage at the 9:30, including Minor Threat, Bob Dylan, Beastie Boys, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Adele, earning the club many recognitions, most notably, four “Nightclub of the Year” awards presented by the publication Pollstar. Through the club’s success as a concert hall and nightclub, the 9:30 remains relevant today.</p>
          <p>The CBGB club was another famous venue that was located on the island of Manhattan in New York that was opened in 1973 by musician, Hilly Kristal. The club hosted musicians of varying genres, including folk, jazz, and acoustic rock, given that CBGB is an acronym for “country, bluegrass, and blues;”  however, it still became a famous venue of hardcore punk concerts. The Ramones, Talking Heads, and Bad Brains were among the many bands who performed at the club. Unfortunately, the CBGB encountered monetary problems and was forced to shut down after a Patti Smith concert in October of 2006. After it closed, the club was bought by investors who wanted to keep its legacy alive. They created the CBGB Music Festival which showcased about 300 rock bands. According to an article in the NY Times, investors chanted remarks like “CBGB is Dead. Long Live CBGB,” and explained that they were supporting the live music culture in New York and the widely loved club by creating the music festival. Although CBGB was not around for very long, its legacy still lives on today through both the music festival and its many dedicated fans.</p>
