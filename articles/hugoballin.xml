            <p>Hugo Ballin is an artist with amazing talent. Ballin was born on March 7, 1879 in New York, New York.  He moved to Santa Monica, where he lived to be 77 years old when he died on November 27, 1956.</p> 
            <p>Ballin began drawing as a kid, and his love for the arts continued to grow throughout his life.  After he graduated high  school Ballin studied Art Students League in New York, and afterwards, spent several years traveling and studying in Italy. Ballin was most famous for his murals, but he also produced and directed over 100 silent films, and wrote a number of novels.</p>
            <p>Ballin started out as a muralist, painting his first paid mural when he was 34 years old. He composed a mural on the ceiling of the Wisconsin State Capitol. This mural covered the entire ceiling, and around the top of the walls. Ballin also created several murals on the Los Angeles Times building and in the City Hall of Burbank.   Ballin was commissioned to paint a mural for the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, as well as Los Angeles County General Hospital, Wilshire Boulevard Temple, and Griffith Observatory.  His subjects ranged from religion, to knowledge, to everyday life.</p> 
            <p>In 1929 Ballin was hired to paint a mural in the First National Bank of La Jolla; similar to his other murals, history was an essential part of it. The history worked as a medium to communicate the message of the place. The mural, which is divided into three columns starts in the left side with the discovery of the New World in 1492. The ship traveling through the water represents the Spanish expedition led by Christopher Columbus. The cross on the ship portrays the religious beliefs of the Spanish empire that at the time was ruled by the Spanish Catholic Monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand II. Farther to the right of the first panel, it depicts the discovery of the new land, indigenous people, and depictions of conquest, an example of which is Spanish architecture in the background. The conquest of the political and legal system is portrayed through the Spanish soldier who is claiming territory by imposing the Spanish flag. The priest and the Virgin Mary on the flag represent the imposition of the Catholic religion on the indigenous peoples.</p> 
            <p>In the center of the mural a diverse group of men is displayed surrounding a table. The wooden roof separates it from the rest of the mural while highlighting its importance. Here, different types of men, Spaniards, Indians, poor and rich, gather to make arrangements, trades, and business deals. The mural portrays a message of the importance of money and business among all different types of people regardless of social status, background or economic standing.</p> 
            <p>In the third column, a family is seen traveling by wagon. The wife is of white complexion and the husband is of dark complexion. They have a baby that represents the “mestizo” or mixed population that was born as the Europeans and the natives started to mix. Their travel represents the immigration groups that arrived in Southern California in search of a better life.  Arriving in present day 1929, modernized Southern California is depicted through its technology and architecture. The details included in this column show the ongoing events of the era. The feature airplane is a representation of a new strategy of combat that was just introduced in the First World War. The Cathedral is one of many different types of buildings that were built in Southern California. It draws connections to Spanish origins while still implementing new ways and ideas of architecture.</p> 
            <p>Whether it was the urge to depict history through a brush or the simply idea that history would be preserved, Hugo Ballin captivated many attributes of the history of his locations, specifically noted in the National Bank Mural. His work lives on to remind its observers of the origin of the new world in which they currently live.</p>
