        <h1>Los Angeles: the City and the Library</h1>
        
        <p class="byline">Colleen Jaurretche, Editor</p>

        <p>The City and the Library is a freshman composition class that trains students in research and writing, all the while asking them to engage the city around them through direct encounter and library research. The capstone of the class requires students to work directly with the Library’s archives, touching and pondering evidence of the city past. This website houses images of those archival artifacts as well as the students’ annotations of the material, cross-referenced by subject and geography. It represents a collaboration between UCLA Writing Programs and the UCLA Library. The class began in Fall 2013, the digital project in Fall 2015; both are ongoing</p>
